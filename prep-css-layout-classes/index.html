        <h3>Temple of Doom</h3>
        <p>Indiana Jones ends up sticking his nose in someone else's business
        of children slavery and kidnapping in India. There's a token asian
        kid for comedic relief and representation possibly. Also a token
        female character Indiana tries to woo over. As if that weren't
        enough, there's another token dangerous booby trap lined location.

        <h3>The Last Crusade</h3>
        <p>Indiana Jones looks for another historical artifact, but is moreso
          intrigued by how his own father was searching for it and never
          returned. Nazis once again look for the same historical artifact.
          Some action scenes to see who gets the artifact first. Some people
          die. Indiana and father survives.</p>
